## 📊 [./binary_classification.py](binary_classification.py) — Bootstrap Classification and SHAP Analysis

This script performs a complete classification and interpretability pipeline using a synthetic radiomic dataset. It is designed for testing machine learning workflows based on XGBoost classifiers, including bootstrap performance evaluation and SHAP-based feature importance analysis.

🔧 Main functionalities:   
- Repeated bootstrap resampling for model training and testing (the number of bootstrap iterations can be modified by editing the M variable in the script)
- Performance evaluation through:
  - Accuracy
  - Balanced Accuracy
  - Average Precision
  - AUROC
  - Confusion matrix generation
  - ROC curve interpolation and export
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) summary plot for model interpretability
- Automatic saving of results to a timestamped directory

📥 Input: a CSV file: synthetic_radiomics_dataset.csv, which must include:
- Patient: Unique patient ID
- Group: Binary target class (0 or 1)
- feature_1 to feature_N: Radiomic-style feature columns

📤 Output   
All results are saved in a folder named results_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS, including:
- CSV files with training and test performance metrics (-Train_scores.csv, -Test_scores.csv)
- Numpy file with all confusion matrices (-Confusion_matrices.npy)
- Interpolated ROC coordinates (_ROC_coords_test.csv)
- SHAP summary bar plot (-SHAP_summary.png)

▶️ How to run   
```python binary_classification.py```

🧪 Notes
- This script is designed for testing purposes and runs on fully synthetic data.
- The SHAP plot assumes class labels are [0, 1], corresponding to a binary classification scenario.

## 📈 ROC & Confusion Matrix Visualization (`plot_results.py`)

This script generates graphical summaries of the model performance after bootstrap evaluation:

- **Confusion Matrix**:  
  Shows the average confusion matrix over all bootstrap test sets, including 95% bootstrap intervals for each cell. The matrix is saved as `Group0-Group1-CM_scaled.png`.

- **ROC Curve**:  
  Plots the median ROC curve across bootstrap iterations, along with the 25th and 75th percentile true positive rates. The AUC and Youden's index point are also reported. The ROC plot is saved as `Group0-Group1_ROC_AUC_median_roc.png`.

#### Input:
- Requires a valid `results_*` directory generated by `bootstrap_xgboost_analysis.py`, containing:
  - `Group0-Group1-Confusion_matrices.npy`
  - `Group0-Group1_ROC_coords_test.csv`

#### Output:
- All images are saved in a folder named `images_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` generated at runtime.

🛠 The script assumes the presence of a `make_confusion_matrix` function in `utils.py`.

## 🧪 Synthetic Test Data

This repository includes a synthetic dataset (synthetic_radiomics_dataset.csv) created exclusively for testing and demonstration purposes. The dataset was artificially generated and does not contain any real patient data. It simulates a typical radiomics scenario, consisting of:   
- 100 observations representing individual patients
- 10 numerical features (feature_1 to feature_10) mimicking radiomic variables
- A binary group label (Group = 0 or 1) representing two hypothetical subpopulations
- A unique patient identifier (Patient)

To introduce distinguishable patterns between groups, the features for each group were sampled from normal distributions with different means (Group 0: mean = 0, Group 1: mean = 1). These differences simulate the kind of variability radiomics may capture between clinical classes, enabling testing of classification models and visualizations (e.g., SHAP analysis) in a fully anonymized and ethical context.

**This dataset is not derived from real medical imaging and should be used only for testing code and validating pipelines, not for clinical or scientific inference.**
